## Open Programme

Thanks to Cyberport.hk and Amazon Web Services, we have set up several open programmes to help our users train, test and deploy computer vision models.

- Open Models Programme. If you are interested in publishing a new model, we could sponsor you for the training and evaluating on AWS.

- Enterprise Startup Programme. If you are an eligible small to medium size company and would like to adopt computer vision into your product, we could provide you with free one-to-one consulting service.
