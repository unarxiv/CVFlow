### Build from Source

If you are looking for cutting edge features, we would recommend you build cvpm and IAE from source.

#### Prepare Build Environment

To build IAE from source, you will need at least node v8.0+. We only test the build process with latest node.

To build CVPM from source, you will need at least Golang compiler at least v1.12. The build status can be viewed at [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/unarxiv/CVPM).

#### Prepare Source Code


```shell
# download IAE code to ./IAE
git clone https://github.com/unarxiv/IAE.git  
# download cvpm code to ./cvpm
git clone https://github.com/unarxiv/cvpm.git 
```
